# This project is part of Cohere Sandbox, Cohere's Experimental Open Source    #
# offering. This project provides a library, tooling, or demo making use of    #
# the Cohere Platform. You should expect (self-)documented, high quality code  #
# but be warned that this is EXPERIMENTAL. Therefore, also expect rough edges, #
# non-backwards compatible changes, or potential changes in functionality as   #
# the library, tool, or demo evolves. Please consider referencing a specific   #
# git commit or version if depending upon the project in any mission-critical  #
# code as part of your own projects.                                           #
#                                                                              #
# Please don't hesitate to raise issues or submit pull requests, and thanks    #
# for checking out this project!                                               #
